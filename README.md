FUNCTIONS AS FIRST-CLASS OBJECTS

Objects in JavaScript enjoy certain capabilities:

- They can be created via literals.
- They can be assigned to variables, array entries, and properties of other objects.
- They can be passed as arguments to functions.
- They can be returned as values from functions.
- They can possess properties that can be dynamically created and assigned.

function declaration:

function test(){
}

var test=function(){
}

scopes are declared by functions, and not by blocks.
--------
function invocation

- function call
- method call
- constructor call
- apply and call
